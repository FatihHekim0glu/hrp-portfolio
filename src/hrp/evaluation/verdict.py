"""Pure-function verdict derivation.

The headline verdict is a PURE FUNCTION of the inference outputs
``(jkm_pvalue, deflated_sharpe, ci_low, ci_high)`` from a fixed enum. It cannot
emit "HRP beats 1/N" while the bootstrap confidence interval straddles zero — the
truth table is unit-tested. This is what keeps the README honest: the verdict is
derived, not narrated.

Importing this module has no side effects.

    r"""Derive the headline verdict from inference outputs (pure function).

    Decision rule (truth-table unit-tested):

    1. If the bootstrap CI straddles zero (``ci_low <= 0 <= ci_high``) OR the JKM
       test is insignificant (``jkm_pvalue >= alpha``) OR the deflated Sharpe
       fails its threshold (``deflated_sharpe < dsr_threshold``), return
       :attr:`Verdict.NO_SIGNIFICANT_DIFFERENCE`. (A significant claim requires
       ALL three to agree.)
    2. Otherwise, if the CI is strictly positive (``ci_low > 0``), return
       :attr:`Verdict.HRP_BEATS_1N`.
    3. Otherwise (CI strictly negative, ``ci_high < 0``), return
       :attr:`Verdict.HRP_LOSES_TO_1N`.

    HONESTY REQUIREMENT: this function MUST NOT return :attr:`Verdict.HRP_BEATS_1N`
    whenever the CI includes zero, regardless of the point estimate. The verdict
    is a deterministic consequence of the evidence, never a narrative choice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    jkm_pvalue:
        The Jobson-Korkie-Memmel two-sided p-value for the Sharpe gap.
    deflated_sharpe:
        The deflated Sharpe ratio (FULL-grid ``n_trials``) of the HRP strategy.
    ci_low, ci_high:
        The bootstrap confidence-interval bounds on the Sharpe gap
        (``HRP - 1/N``).
    alpha:
        Significance level for the JKM test (default ``0.05``).
    dsr_threshold:
        Minimum deflated Sharpe required to support a positive claim
        (default ``0.95``).

    Returns
    -------
    Verdict
        The derived headline verdict.

    Raises
    ------
    ValidationError
